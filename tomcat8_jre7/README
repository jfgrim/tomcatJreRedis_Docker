Usage simple

docker run -d -v webappsFolder:webappsFolder -v propertiesFolder:propertiesFolder -p 8080:8080 jfgrimault/tomcat8jre7

If you want to see the tomcat's log directly, you can change option "-ti" with "-d".

IIf you push a WAR file in your host's folder Webapps declared in "webappsFolder" option, Tomcat start with your WAR. You can put properties file in your host's "propertiesFolder"

_Usage Link with MRC (jfgrimault / mysqld-redis-couchbase in  https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jfgrimault/mysqld-redis-couchbase/)_

docker run -ti --dns=DNS_SERVER_IP --dns-search=domain.local --name=tomcat -v /data/webapps:/data/webapps --link MRC:MRC -v /tmp:/tmp -p 9080:8080 jfgrimault/tomcat8jre7
When the container start, SSH's tunnel start with MYSQL, REDIS and COUCHBASE port in local. In this container, you'll accessed in mysql with your tomcat's application in localhost et port = 3306. It's the same for REDIS and Couchbase

The first time that you run your container, a new user admin with all privileges will be created in Tomcat with a random password. To get the password, check the logs of the container by running:

docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>
You will see an output like the following:

========================================================================
You can now connect to this Tomcat server using:

    admin:b1uKcRK3r6SF

Please remember to change the above password as soon as possible!
========================================================================
In this case, b1uKcRK3r6SF is the password allocated to the admin user.

You can now login to you admin console to configure your tomcat server:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/manager/html
http://127.0.0.1:8080/host-manager/html
Setting a specific password for the admin account

If you want to use a preset password instead of a random generated one, you can set the environment variable TOMCAT_PASS to your specific password when running the container:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e TOMCAT_PASS="mypass" jfgrimault / tomcat8jre7
You can now test your deployment:

http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Done!
